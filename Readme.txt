I'm in the process of developing a BMS for use on an E-Bike I would like to purchase.

I have made some changes to the schematic design, and am working within kicad.
The schematic is complete. Next step is to design the PCB

The plan is to have a board with headers and an arduino nano controller built in. 
5 volt power output for the arduino power and to power external devices like charge phones.
Fuses and TVS for mechanical overcurrent and over voltage protection on the charge and discharge ports
passive high current ballancing on all cells
etc.

I intend to use code developed by nseidle and have already used some ideas from his PCB design. 

There is no timeline for this project. My personal budget and time constraints will set the pace of development.

I'll keep you updated.
